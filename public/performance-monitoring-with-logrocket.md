# Performance Monitoring with LogRocket

## Introduction

Even with comprehensive error tracking and testing, it can be difficult to understand what your users are actually experiencing. Sometimes, users report bugs that you can't reproduce because you lack the context of their session.

**LogRocket** is a frontend monitoring and session replay tool that helps you understand user experience like never before. It combines session replay, performance monitoring, and error tracking to give you a complete picture of every user session.

## Core Features

*   **Session Replay**: This is LogRocket's killer feature. It records user sessions and allows you to play them back as a video. You can see exactly what the user saw, where they clicked, what they typed, and any errors that occurred. This is incredibly powerful for debugging and understanding user behavior.
*   **Performance Monitoring**: LogRocket automatically captures key performance metrics (Core Web Vitals), network requests, and CPU/memory usage, helping you identify and fix performance bottlenecks.
*   **Error Tracking**: It captures JavaScript errors and associates them with the corresponding session replay, so you can see the exact sequence of events that led to the error.
*   **Redux Logging**: It has built-in integration with Redux, allowing you to see every action and state change as you watch a session replay.

## How It Works

LogRocket's SDK records the DOM mutations, network requests, and console logs in a user's session. It sends this data to the LogRocket service, which reconstructs the session for you to replay. The overhead is designed to be minimal and not impact user experience.

## Code Example: Setting up LogRocket

Setting up LogRocket is similar to other monitoring tools. You initialize it at the entry point of your application.

```jsx
// main.jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import LogRocket from 'logrocket';
import App from './App';

// Initialize LogRocket
// The App ID is found in your LogRocket project settings
LogRocket.init('your-logrocket-app-id');

// --- Optional: Identify Users ---
// If a user is logged in, you can identify them to associate sessions
// with their user ID and other traits.
const user = {
  id: 'user-123',
  name: 'Jane Doe',
  email: 'jane.doe@example.com',
  // You can add any custom data
  subscriptionType: 'premium',
};
LogRocket.identify(user.id, {
  name: user.name,
  email: user.email,
  subscriptionType: user.subscriptionType,
});


const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```

With just this small snippet, LogRocket will begin recording all user sessions. When an error occurs, you can go to the LogRocket dashboard, find the session, and watch a video replay of exactly what the user did to trigger the bug.

### Capturing Errors Manually

While LogRocket captures unhandled exceptions automatically, you can also capture errors manually for more context.

```jsx
import LogRocket from 'logrocket';

try {
  // some operation that might fail
} catch (error) {
  // You can capture the error and add extra context
  LogRocket.captureException(error, {
    extra: {
      componentName: 'BillingForm',
      cartId: 'cart-abc-123',
    },
  });
}
```

Tools like LogRocket are invaluable for any production application. They close the gap between your development environment and the real-world usage of your product, providing deep insights that are impossible to get from error logs alone.
