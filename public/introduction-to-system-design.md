# Introduction to System Design

## What is System Design?

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. In the context of backend engineering, it's about making high-level decisions for building a software system that is reliable, scalable, and maintainable.

It's about answering questions like:
*   How do we support millions of users?
*   How do we ensure the system doesn't go down?
*   How do we make the system fast and responsive?
*   What is the right database for the job?
*   How should different parts of the system communicate?

The key to system design is not finding the one "perfect" solution, but understanding the **trade-offs** between different choices.

## Core Principles of a Well-Designed System

While functional requirements define *what* a system does, non-functional requirements define *how* a system should be. The most important ones are:

*   **Scalability**: The ability of the system to handle a growing amount of work. This is usually achieved through **horizontal scaling** (adding more servers) rather than **vertical scaling** (making one server more powerful).
*   **Availability**: The system should be operational and accessible to users. High availability is achieved by eliminating single points of failure through **redundancy** and failover mechanisms.
*   **Performance**: The system should be fast and responsive. **Latency** (the time to complete a request) is a key metric. Performance is improved through techniques like caching, database indexing, and efficient communication protocols.
*   **Reliability**: The system should function correctly and consistently. This involves robust error handling, fault tolerance, and data integrity.
*   **Maintainability**: The system should be easy to understand, modify, and extend over time. This is achieved through clean architecture, modularity, and good documentation.

## A Basic High-Level Architecture

Most scalable web applications are built from a common set of building blocks. Understanding how these components fit together is the first step in designing a large-scale system.

    User --> CDN[Content Delivery Network (CDN)];
    CDN --> LB[Load Balancer];
    LB --> WebServers[Web Server Fleet (Stateless)];
    WebServers <--> Cache[Cache (e.g., Redis)];
    WebServers --> DB_Primary[(Primary DB)];
    DB_Primary -- "Writes" --> WebServers;
    DB_Primary -- "Replication" --> DB_Replica[(Read Replica DB)];
    WebServers -- "Reads" --> DB_Replica;
    WebServers --> MQ((Message Queue));
    MQ --> Workers[Background Workers];

1.  **User Request**: The journey begins with a user's request.
2.  **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: For global applications, a **CDN** is the first point of contact. It caches static content (images, JS, CSS) at edge locations close to the user, dramatically reducing latency.
3.  **Load Balancer**: The request then hits a **Load Balancer**. Its job is to distribute incoming traffic across a fleet of web servers, preventing any single server from being overwhelmed. This is the key to horizontal scaling and high availability.
4.  **Web Servers**: These servers handle the business logic. They are designed to be **stateless**, meaning they don't store any data that needs to persist between requests. This allows us to add or remove servers from the fleet at any time.
5.  **Cache**: To improve performance and reduce load on the database, the web servers first check a distributed **Cache** (like Redis) for the requested data. Serving data from an in-memory cache is orders of magnitude faster than querying a database.
6.  **Database**: This is the system's source of truth.
    *   **Replication**: A common pattern is to have a single **Primary (Master)** database that handles all write operations, and multiple **Read Replicas** that handle read operations. This scales read-heavy applications.
    *   **Partitioning**: For massive datasets, the data is often split across multiple databases, a technique known as **sharding** or **data partitioning**.
7.  **Message Queue**: For long-running or asynchronous tasks (like sending an email or processing a video), the web server places a job in a **Message Queue**. This allows the server to respond to the user immediately.
8.  **Background Workers**: A separate fleet of worker servers consumes jobs from the message queue and processes them asynchronously.

Each of these components represents a core system design concept. The following topics will dive deeper into each one.
