# Machine Learning in Backend Systems

## Introduction

Integrating Machine Learning (ML) models into backend services, often called "ML Ops," involves taking a trained model and making it available to serve predictions in a live production environment.

For a backend engineer, this isn't about training models, but about building the infrastructure and APIs to run them reliably, scalably, and efficiently. The goal is to bridge the gap between a model in a data scientist's notebook and a model that can serve millions of users.

## Model-as-a-Service Pattern

The most common and flexible deployment pattern is to wrap the ML model in its own dedicated microservice. The main backend application calls this service via an API to get predictions in real-time.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client App] --> B{Main Backend API};
    B -- "1. Receives request (e.g., user ID)" --> B;
    B -- "2. Gathers features from DB" --> DB[(Database)];
    DB -- "Feature data" --> B;
    B -- "3. Sends feature vector via HTTP" --> C{ML Model Service};
    
    subgraph C
        direction LR
        D[API Layer (Flask/FastAPI)] --> E[Model Inference];
    end

    C -- "4. Returns prediction" --> B;
    B -- "5. Uses prediction in business logic" --> B;
    B -- "6. Sends final response" --> A;

    style C fill:#1b263b,stroke:#00f5d4,stroke-width:2px;
```
This pattern decouples the model's lifecycle from the main application, allowing it to be updated and scaled independently.

## Code Examples

### 1. The Python ML Model Service (Flask)
This service loads a pre-trained model and exposes a `/predict` endpoint.

<pre><code class="language-python">
# app.py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
# In a real app, you'd use a real model library like scikit-learn or tensorflow
# from joblib import load
# model = load('model.joblib')

app = Flask(__name__)

# Dummy model for demonstration: predicts if a number is even or odd
def dummy_predict(features):
    # Features should be a list, e.g., [5]
    number = features[0]
    return "even" if number % 2 == 0 else "odd"

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    try:
        data = request.get_json()
        features = data.get('features')
        if not features:
            return jsonify({'error': 'Missing features'}), 400
        
        # In a real app: prediction = model.predict([features])
        prediction = dummy_predict(features)
        
        return jsonify({'prediction': prediction})
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5001, debug=True)
</code></pre>

### 2. Calling the Service from Other Backends
Here's how other services would call the prediction API.

<div class="code-tabs">
  <div class="tab-buttons">
    <button class="tab-button active" data-lang="nodejs">Node.js Client</button>
    <button class="tab-button" data-lang="go">Go Client</button>
  </div>
  <div class="tab-content active" data-lang="nodejs">
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

async function getPrediction(features) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5001/predict', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ features: features }),
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Prediction service failed with status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    const result = await response.json();
    console.log(`Prediction for ${features[0]} is:`, result.prediction);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error calling prediction service:', error);
  }
}

getPrediction([5]); // -> "odd"
getPrediction([10]); // -> "even"
</code></pre>
  </div>
  <div class="tab-content" data-lang="go">
<pre><code class="language-go">
package main

import (
	"bytes"
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func getPrediction(features []int) {
	requestBody, _ := json.Marshal(map[string][]int{
		"features": features,
	})

	resp, err := http.Post("http://localhost:5001/predict", "application/json", bytes.NewBuffer(requestBody))
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error calling prediction service:", err)
		return
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()

	var result map[string]string
	json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(&result)

	fmt.Printf("Prediction for %d is: %s\n", features[0], result["prediction"])
}

func main() {
	getPrediction([]int{5})  // -> "odd"
	getPrediction([]int{10}) // -> "even"
}
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

## Challenges and Considerations
*   **Model Versioning**: You need a system to track different versions of a model and easily roll back if a new one performs poorly.
*   **Monitoring**: You must monitor not only operational metrics (latency, errors) but also model performance metrics (accuracy, data drift). **Data drift** occurs when production data starts to look different from the training data, degrading performance.
*   **Feature Consistency**: The features sent to the model for prediction must be generated in the *exact same way* as they were for training. A centralized **Feature Store** can help solve this.
*   **A/B Testing**: It's rarely a good idea to switch all traffic to a new model at once. Use canary deployments or A/B tests to compare a new model's performance against the old one in a live environment.
*   **Resource Management**: ML models can be resource-intensive (CPU/GPU, memory). The infrastructure must be able to scale to handle the prediction load.
